# Basics-of-Python
This repository contains the basic concepts of python for the beginners.

## Introduction to Python
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991. Learning Python gives the programmer a wide variety of career paths to choose from. Python is an open-source (free) programming language that is used in web programming, data science, artificial intelligence, and many scientific applications. Learning Python allows the programmer to focus on solving problems, rather than focusing on syntax. Its relative size and simplified syntax give it an edge over languages like Java and C++, yet the abundance of libraries gives it the power needed to accomplish great things.

# Why Learn Python?
Python is one of the most loved programming languages by developers, data scientists, software engineers, and even hackers because of its versatility, flexibility, and object-oriented features. Many of the web and mobile applications we enjoy today is because of Python’s abundant libraries, various frameworks, vast collections of modules, and file extensions. Not only that, Python is great for building micro-project to macro enterprise web services as well as on supporting other types of programming languages.
Although it’s a high-level language and can do complex tasks, Python is easy to learn and has a clean syntax. Therefore, its recommendable for both beginners and experienced programmers. Also, there are plenty of ways on how to learn Python; you can do self-study, enroll yourself in coding bootcamp or school or watch online tutorials. The choice is yours to make!

# Skills required for Python
Python developers should posses the following skills and qualifications:

Knowledge of Python web frameworks and event-driven programming in Python
Basic understanding of front-end technologies
High attention to detail
Excellent communication and problem-solving skills
Proficient understanding of code versioning tools
Security background or basic 101 type understanding
Good understanding of server-side templating languages
Strong unit test and debugging skills
Basic knowledge of front-end technologies, such as HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3

# Roadmap
There is plenty of documentation and videos available online so it’s very confusing where to start learning this language especially when Python can be used in various fields. Understand that a single book or video course is not enough to teach you everything in Python and initially as a beginner, you will also get overwhelmed with so many concepts but have patience, explore and stay committed to it. Below are some resources we have filtered out to start learning Python but make sure that whatever resource you prefer your code along with it.

If you already have experience in programming then learn from the official documentation: 3.8.1. or learn from Python Tutorial GeeksforGeeks. You can also go for some online video tutorials or courses but most of the courses will start from the beginners level (that’s just a waste of time), still, it depends on you and your prior experience in coding.
If you are a beginner and reading the documentation is boring for you then choose a comprehensive Python online course. One of the courses which is good for beginners is the Python Programming Foundation -Self-Paced course which is specially curated here at Geeksforgeeks by Sandeep Jain and gives an entire knowledge of Python from scratch.
